# <API-QUIZ-PROJECT>

## Description

- My motivation was to use my newly fond information of API/S and apply that new knowledge to create a quiz based of coding concepts
- I built this project to demonstrate my knowledge of said API usage
- This solved my problem of being able to understand and implement API usage into my own code as well as use local storage to set up high scores
- I learned that pseudo coding and breaking down content into different pages really helps the overall process


## Installation
